* Ability to load a 128K ROM cartridge, e.g. physical cartridge or FinalGROM99

## Optional

* F18A or PICO9918 for faster gameplay (1)

(1) The TMS9918A has a bug that prevents the use or more than 8 sprites in the graphics mode optimal for fast smooth scrolling.
F18A and clones don't have this bug, so here the game can run in the optimal mode.
